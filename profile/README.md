fdaPDE is a library for physics-informed statistical learning of spatial and functional data, at the intersection bet>

fdaPDE offers a wide range of modeling capabilities, such as regression, non-parametric density estimation, functional data analysis and more, for data located over a spatial domain, possibly evolving in time.

## Get started

fdaPDE is a C++ library which interfaces with R, one of the most popular language for data analysis, and runs on all major platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows). To get started, see the [documentation site](https://fdapde.github.io/). 

_Currently a new version of the library is under development, the documentation site refers to such development stage_

## News

The fdaPDE team will present a short course on physics-informed statistical learning at the International Workshop on Statistical Modeling ([IWSM25](https://iwsm2025.ie/)), taking place in Limerick, Ireland, on July 13, 2025. For details on the topics covered, visit [this link](https://iwsm2025.ie/programme/short-course/).
